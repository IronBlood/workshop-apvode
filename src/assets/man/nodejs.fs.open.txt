fs.open(path[, flags[, mode]], callback)

* path <string> | <Buffer> | <URL>
* flags <string> | <number> See support of file system flags.
  Default: 'r'.
* mode <string> | <integer> Default: 0o666 (readable and writable)
* callback <Function>
    * err <Error>
    * fd <integer>

    Asynchronous file open. See the POSIX open(2) documentation
    for more details.

    mode sets  the  file mode (permission and sticky bits), but
    only  if the file was created.  On Windows,  only the write
    permission can be manipulated; see fs.chmod().
