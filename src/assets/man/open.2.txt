NAME
    open, openat, creat - open and possibly create a file

SYNOPSIS
    int open(const char *pathname, int flags);

DESCRIPTION
    The open() system call opens the file specified by pathname.
    If the specified  file  does  not  exist, it may optionally
    (if O_CREAT is specified in flags) be created by open().

    The  return  value of open()  is a file descriptor, a small,
    nonnegative integer that  is used in subsequent system calls
    (read(2),  write(2), lseek(2),  fcntl(2),  etc.) to refer to
    the open file. The file descriptor returned by a successful
    call will be the lowest-numbered file descriptor not curren-
    tly open for the process.
