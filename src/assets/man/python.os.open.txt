os.open(path, flags, mode=0o777, *, dir_fd=None)

    Open the file  path  and  set various  flags according to
	flags  and  possibly  its  mode according  to mode.  When
	computing  mode,  the current umask value is first masked
	out. Return the file descriptor for the newly opened file.
	The new file descriptor is non-inheritable.

    For a description of the flag and mode values, see the C
	run-time documentation; flag constants (like O_RDONLY and
	O_WRONLY) are defined in the os module. In particular, on
	Windows adding O_BINARY is needed to open files in binary
	mode.
